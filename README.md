# NeuroTensor
Version: v0.1.0
NeuroTensor is a tensor framework that has a tda and autograd wrapper built in. The syntax follows PyTorch's closely, but in C++. Current version is 0.1.0 and there is still much to come for added support and testing. This is an early beta version. This is meant to be a framework for computational neuroscience tools.
